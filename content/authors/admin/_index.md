I am a research assistant in the [Biological Control Systems Lab](https://rtanaka.bg-research.cc.ic.ac.uk/), led by [Dr Reiko Tanaka](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/r.tanaka), in the Department of Bioengineering of Imperial College London.

My research is on the development of statistical machine learning models to predict and control eczema, with a particular interest in Bayesian statistics and time-series forecasting.
