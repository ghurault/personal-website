I am a data scientist at [Pythia Sports](https://www.pythiasports.com/) working on sport analytics.

Previously, I was a researcher in the [Biological Control Systems Lab](https://rtanaka.bg-research.cc.ic.ac.uk/) at [Imperial College London](https://imperial.ac.uk/), developing statistical and machine learning models to predict and control eczema.
