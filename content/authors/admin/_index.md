I am a Senior Data Scientist working in sport analytics to predict the outcome of sports events.

Before this, I worked as a Data Scientist in the renewable energy sector to forecast electricity demand, generation and prices.
I started my career as a researcher at [Imperial College London](https://imperial.ac.uk/) in the [Biological Control Systems Lab](https://www.rtanakagroup.com/), developing predictive models for eczema.
