I am a research assistant and PhD student in the [Biological Control Systems Lab](http://www.bg.ic.ac.uk/research/r.tanaka/index.html), under the supervision of [Dr Reiko Tanaka](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/r.tanaka), in the Department of Bioengineering of Imperial College London.

My research is on the development of statistical machine learning models to predict and control eczema, with a particular interest in Bayesian statistics and time-series forecasting.
